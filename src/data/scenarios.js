    story: "Mauress was riding his bike at a local park when he fell and hit his head on the pavement. He was not wearing a helmet. He lost consciousness briefly (approximately 30 seconds according to his parents). On arrival to the ED, he is confused but follows commands. His parents are anxious about his condition.",

        title: "Initial Assessment Priority",
        question: "Mauress presents with a GCS of 12 (E3V4M5) following a head injury. His parents are visibly distressed. What is your immediate priority?",
        options: [
          "Administer pain medication to comfort the child",
          "Conduct a thorough neurological assessment",
          "Reassure parents while observing for changes",
          "Immediately call for neurosurgical consultation"
        ],
        feedback: [
          "INCORRECT: Administering analgesics before full assessment can mask neurological signs and interfere with accurate pain evaluation. NSAIDs may also increase bleeding risk.",
          "CORRECT: A systematic neurological assessment must be completed first to establish baseline function, identify acute changes, and guide subsequent interventions. This includes pupil assessment, motor function, and cognitive evaluation.",
          "PARTIALLY CORRECT: While family-centered care is important, the priority is clinical assessment. Observation alone without systematic evaluation may miss critical neurological changes.",
          "PARTIALLY CORRECT: Specialist consultation may be needed, but shouldn't delay initial assessment. Emergency nurses must complete primary and secondary surveys first."
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        rationale: "In pediatric TBI, immediate neurological assessment is crucial because children can deteriorate rapidly. The GCS of 12 indicates moderate TBI requiring close monitoring. Establishing baseline neurological status guides all subsequent care decisions (PECARN Guidelines, 2021).",

        title: "Diagnostic Decisions",
        question: "Your initial assessment shows Mauress is confused, with equal and reactive pupils (4mm), normal motor function, but exhibits retrograde amnesia. What is your next priority?",
        options: [
          "Order a CT scan of the head",
          "Continue observation for 2 hours",
          "Start IV access and begin fluid resuscitation",
          "Transfer to a higher level of care immediately"
        ],
        feedback: [
          "CORRECT: CT scan is indicated for pediatric patients with GCS <15, loss of consciousness, and amnesia. Early imaging helps identify intracranial hemorrhage, fractures, or cerebral edema that require immediate intervention.",
          "INCORRECT: Active monitoring alone is insufficient with current symptoms. The combination of LOC, amnesia, and altered mental status requires imaging to rule out intracranial injury.",
          "PARTIALLY CORRECT: IV access is important but not the priority. Mauress is hemodynamically stable; diagnostic imaging takes precedence to guide treatment.",
          "PARTIALLY CORRECT: Transfer decisions should be based on imaging results and available resources. Premature transfer without diagnosis may delay appropriate care."

        correctAnswer: 0,

        feedback: [
          "INCORRECT: Discharge is inappropriate with ongoing neurological symptoms. Children with persistent confusion and headache require monitoring for deterioration.",

          "INCORRECT: No indication for antibiotics without signs of infection. CT showed no open wounds or CSF leak requiring antimicrobial coverage.",
          "INCORRECT: Seizure prophylaxis isn't routinely indicated in mild-moderate TBI without seizure activity. Risk-benefit ratio doesn't support prophylactic use."

        correctAnswer: 1,

        feedback: [
          "INCORRECT: Treating symptoms without addressing underlying cause is dangerous. Worsening neurological symptoms require immediate evaluation, not symptomatic treatment.",
          "CORRECT: Deteriorating neurological status (increased confusion, worsening headache) with previously normal CT suggests evolving pathology. Immediate physician notification and reassessment are crucial to detect increased ICP or delayed hemorrhage.",
